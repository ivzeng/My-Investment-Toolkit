# This is my investment journal program.

### The program
-   provides a simple user interface that allow you to store and analyze your trades;
-   allows you to switch among multiple accounts;



### More functions will be added in the future, including:

-   providing suggestions on trading based on several provided strategies;
-   optimizing the configuration parameters for some strategy based on historical data (maybe by regression models on profits vs configuration vector and linear optimization; it is my main goal of this project)
